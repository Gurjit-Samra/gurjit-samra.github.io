                    Hi there, I’m currently pursuing a computer science degree at the University of Calgary. 
                    I have been in love with technology ever since I was young, from the first iPods to the current Playstation. 
                    I’ve loved seeing and experiencing firsthand how tech has kept changing the way we work, play, and socialize. 
                    My passion for technology drives me to learn and experiment. 
                    I’ve enjoyed being a student in such an innovative field and look forward to applying my growing skills towards impactful projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I continue to work on projects in and out of my time at University. I’ve collaborated within teams up to 20 people, and have experience using communication tools like Trello, Slack and Discord to effectively communicate. 
                    I am most experienced in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and Python,  with an evolving knowledge of other libraries and frameworks such as React.js and Three.js. 
                    I am currently improving my data science skills with the help of Python and Julia.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I am not coding, I love to go on hikes, read great novels, and spend time with my family and friends. I am also a huge fan of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and 
                    love to train mixed martial arts to stay sharp and in shape.
